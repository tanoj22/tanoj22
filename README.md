# Hi, I'm Sai Tanoj 👋

A few years ago, I was just curious about how computers “see.”  
That curiosity has now grown into a journey! I started with the basics, teaching machines to tell cats from dogs. Today, that same spark drives me to design models that can find tumors in medical scans, explain their predictions, and perhaps contribute to saving lives.           


## 🌱 My Journey So Far
I started my academic path in Computer Science with a focus on AI and Machine Learning at CVR College of Engineering, India. That’s where I first got hands-on with algorithms, computer vision, and the excitement of making machines see. 

During my time as a Computer Vision Intern at DRDO, I worked on object localization with SSD + VGG16. What struck me was how real-world challenges, like training on unannotated data, demanded more than just applying a model. I learned to innovate with weakly- and semi-supervised learning, turning constraints into opportunities.

My curiosity for impactful AI kept growing. Projects became my playground:

🌿 Detecting tomato leaf diseases with deep learning, showing me how AI could help agriculture.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Exploring fairness in gender classification with Fair Adaptive Scaling, because accuracy alone isn’t enough if models are biased.
📝 Fine-tuning a T5 transformer for clinical note summarization, bridging language and healthcare data.
🩻 Building a UNet pipeline for liver tumor segmentation, where I discovered what I call ✨ the magic of chunking - making a CPU-only setup powerful enough for medical AI.

And when I’m not working on formal projects, I just love experimenting with models, testing them out, and seeing what they can do. It’s what I end up doing whenever I’m bored.  


Now, at Northeastern University, where I’m pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering, my focus is sharper than ever: computer vision and explainable AI for medicine. With a strong foundation in projects, publications, and research, I’m committed to pushing AI toward being not just powerful, but also trustworthy and fair.


## 🔬 Publications & Research
📑 Publications

🔬 Early-Stage Identification of Tomato Leaf Diseases using VGG16 and MobileNet
Macaw International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Engineering

This was my first research publication, born out of curiosity about how deep learning could support agriculture. I developed a computer vision model using an ensemble of VGG16 and MobileNet to detect tomato leaf diseases early. What I learned here was how AI can make real-world impact beyond labs, helping farmers prevent crop loss. It also gave me my first taste of how rigorous evaluation and metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) turn experiments into publishable science.

My second publication took me from hands-on model building to research synthesis. I authored a review paper analyzing how different machine learning techniques have been applied for crop yield prediction. This work broadened my perspective: I wasn’t just coding models, I was now evaluating what the field as a whole was doing, its strengths, limitations, and future directions. It taught me to critically assess research, not just contribute to it, and that skill has been invaluable as I transition into advanced projects in medical AI.

## ✨ A Little Philosophy
I see AI as a bridge between raw data and human insight.  
For me, the real promise of AI isn’t in replacing human judgment, but in earning trust by making decisions clearer, fairer, and easier to understand.
